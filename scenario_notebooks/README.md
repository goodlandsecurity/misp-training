# scenario_notebooks

This directory contains the MISP training notebooks that walk through creating MISP events, attaching attributes, and adding context with galaxy cluster tagging for the different sharing scenarios provided.

Make sure to copy `vault/keys.py.sample` to `vault/keys.py` and add your values for `misp_url`, `misp_key`, and `misp_verifycert` before running the notebooks.
