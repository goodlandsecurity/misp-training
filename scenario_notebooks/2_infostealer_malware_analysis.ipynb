    "### Description:\n",
    "An endpoint within the organization was compromised by RedLine Stealer, a known information stealer malware. This malware collects a wide range of data, including stored passwords, browser cookies, autofill data, and cryptocurrency wallets. The stolen information is exfiltrated to a remote Command-and-Control (C2) server.\n",

    "#### Malware Family: \n",
    "- RedlineStealer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Malware Behavior:\n",
    "- RedLine Stealer is capable of harvesting stored credentials from browsers (including passwords, cookies, and autofill data), system information, and cryptocurrency wallet details.\n",
    "- The malware scans the infected system for any stored credentials in browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.\n",
    "- RedLine Stealer also collects additional data like user profiles, system information, and application usage details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exfiltration Method:\n",
    "Once the data is harvested, RedLine Stealer uses HTTP POST requests to transmit the collected information to its designated C2 server (malicious-c2server.com at IP address 198.51.100.23).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Galaxy Clusters to Include:\n",
    "### 1. Attack Pattern:\n",
    " - Credentials from Password Stores (Credentials from Web Browsers):\n",
    "   - Technique ID: T1555.003\n",
    "   - Description: RedLine Stealer targets credential stores in web browsers to extract passwords, cookies, and autofill data.\n",
    " - Input Capture (Keylogging): \n",
    "   - Technique ID: T1056.001\n",
    "   - Description: Some variants of information stealers also include keylogging capabilities to capture credentials as they are typed.\n",
    " - Unsecured Credentials:\n",
    "   - Technique ID: T1552\n",
    "   - Description: Harvesting credentials stored in insecure locations on the system.\n",
    "- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:\n",
    "  - Technique ID: T1041\n",
    "  - Description: RedLine Stealer exfiltrates collected data via HTTP POST requests to a remote C2 server.\n",
    " - Automated Exfiltration:\n",
    "   - Technique ID: T1020\n",
    "   - Description: The malware automates the process of collecting and exfiltrating data without manual intervention.\n",
